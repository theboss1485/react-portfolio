                <p>I am a graduate of Liberty University Online with a degree in Information Technology: Application and Database Development. 
                    live in Ohio in the USA with my family. I am the oldest of three siblings and have one brother and one sister. 
                    I am preparing to get a software development job by going to the OSU Web Development bootcamp.
                    I enjoy playing video games, spending time with my family, and taking walks outside. 
                    After I acquire a higher-paying job, I would like to move into my own house, get married, and start a family.</p>
